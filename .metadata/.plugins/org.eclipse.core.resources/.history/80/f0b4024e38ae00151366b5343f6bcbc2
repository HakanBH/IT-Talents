			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arsene Wenger believes stability and cohesion are key elements to Arsenal's fine form this season.<br>
			The Gunners have claimed three consecutive Premier League wins ahead of their game against Southampton<br>
		 	on Boxing Day. Wenger only made one signing last summer - Petr Cech - and stressed the value of having a<br>
		 	settled squad.<br>

				"Today's society always wants something new." he said. "We have news every half an hour, or every minute.<br>
				You need to announce something new.	"But let's not forget that football is as well about cohesion, about<br>
				stability and that goes a little bit against the demand of what people want. But I still think success is<br>
				linked with talent and cohesion."Cohesion is an under-rated factor now in our society because there is<br>
				always a demand for something new. It's more difficult because people are better informed today. They know<br>
				more straight away. "When a team loses a game, everybody has an opinion and the environment is more<br>
				destabilising than it was ever before, so maybe inside the clubs this kind of cohesion becomes more important,<br>
				and resistance to that destabilising factor becomes more important. "If you look at our record we are more<br>
				consistent with our results. I looked yesterday and someone made the table in 2015 and we are quite ahead of<br>
				everyone else in 2015. The consistency has been quite good.<br>
